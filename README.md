This is a repository containing some of my projects in data analysis.

##PROJECT 1: Sales Dashboard Project (EXCEL)
-Given raw sales data from a bike store, I wanted uncover the patterns and answer questions that would provide more isights to the bike store owners. I wanted to answer questions such as:
  1. What is the average age of the customers making the purchases?
  2. What is the average income of the customers?
  3. What is the commuting distance from work of the customers making the bike purchases?
- Therefore I made a sales dashboard from sample data aiming at providing useful insights on the factors influencing the sales of bikes from the bike store.
SKILLS UTILIZED: 
  1. Pivot tables and pivot charts
  2. Data cleaning and data validation techniques
  3. Extract Transform load(ETL) processes - I loaded the data from an external source.
  4. Power querry for ETL processes
  5. Slicers
