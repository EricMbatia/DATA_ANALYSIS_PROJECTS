# DATA ANALYSIS PROJECTS
This is a repository containing some of my projects in data analysis.

## PROJECT 1: Sales Dashboard Project (EXCEL)
-Given raw sales data from a bike store, I wanted uncover the patterns and answer questions that would provide more isights to the bike store owners. I wanted to answer questions such as:
  1. What is the average age of the customers making the purchases?
  2. What is the average income of the customers?
  3. What is the commuting distance from work of the customers making the bike purchases?
- Therefore I made a sales dashboard from sample data aiming at providing useful insights on the factors influencing the sales of bikes from the bike store.

SKILLS UTILIZED: 
  1. Pivot tables and pivot charts
  2. Data cleaning and data validation techniques
  3. Extract Transform load(ETL) processes - I loaded the data from an external source.
  4. Power querry for ETL processes
  5. Slicers

## PROJECT 2: Data Analysis Project With (PYTHON)
- The dataset contains data on a supermarket chain staore with three branches(A, B and C).
  
### Research Problem:

  The task here was to analyze the data using different data exploration techniques and thereafer give a summary and reccomendations on how best to improve the gross income in the different branches.
My guiding questions:
  1. Which branch has the most number of customers and which branch has the least?
  2. Which is the most common customer type and which is the least?
  3. Which gender makes up the majority in this dataset?
  4. Which is the most common and the least common product line?
  5. Which is the most common method of payment?
  6. What is the average gross income per branch?
  7. What is the average gross income per branch and per product line?
  8. What is the average rating per branch?

SKILLS UTILIZED: 
  1. Data analysis techniques: univariate analysis and bivariate analysis
  2. Pivot tables 
  3. Data exploration techniques using python
  4. Data visualization: heatmaps, pie charts, bar graphs ...etc
  5. Descriptive analysis using python
